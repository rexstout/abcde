TODO:
----
* move the wav files to a different dir if the user wants to keep the tracks
* read the TOC and CDTEXT files and store them
* read the complete CD to a single file, storing TOC seems a good idea to
  recreate the index entries if we decide to burn the cd.
* Make concatenating CD1...Cdn sets into one album possible: Maybe a "start
  with number for files" flag?

* read_and_encode function that uses named pipes for further ripping/encoding
  parallelization where possible
* read_and_encode_and_tag? :)
* Customizable post-read/encode/tag hooks
  (http://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=114851)

* Separate local/dist tagging: if local encoding, the tags are added on the
  encoding phase. If remote, the tracks need tagging.
  And also add the possibility to add this information via oggenc directly
  instead of explicitly invoking vorbiscomment.

* Maybe repair files when they have the same name in the original CD?
  (http://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=205634)

* Separate the different output encodings, so a user can read and encode one
  format and then encode another one, later, from the same wavs. Right now,
  the same status line is used for all formats, so a re-encoding is rejected
  since abcde sees the encoding already finished. Same with tags and moves.

* Support UTF-8 tags

DONE:
----
* FLAC support (http://flac.sourceforge.net/)
* Multiple ogg/mp3/flac output during the same session
* Track padding problem with single songs.
