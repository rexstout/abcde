This is the OLD project home for abcde. We've moved to http://abcde.einval.com/ . Please update your links accordingly!

abcde is a command line (CLI) CD encoder. It will read your CD, contact a CDDB provider, download the track information, rip your CD and store all the encoded tracks in the tree layout you define.

It supports multiple encoders for several formats, such as FLAC, Ogg/Vorbis, MP3,... and will use one single rip to create as many output formats as you want.
